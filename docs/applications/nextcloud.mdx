Nextcloud is an open source, self-hosted file sync and share and communication app platform. Access & sync your files, contacts, calendars & communicate and collaborate across your devices. You decide what happens with your data, where it is and who can access it!

## Installation

As simple as running the following command

```bash
box install nextcloud
```

As Nextcloud is essentially a PHP "Script" running on top of the Nginx + PHP stack, there are no service files available tto allow you to control the applications state.
