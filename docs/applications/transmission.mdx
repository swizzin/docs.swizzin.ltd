Transmission is a cross-platform Torrent client.

## Initial Setup

Simply run this command
```bash main
box install transmission
```

If you are on Ubuntu, you will be offered to use the PPA sources to take updates straight from the transmission team.

The Transmision configuration file will be located in `~/.config/transmission-daemon/settings.json` for each user.

### Install options

import InstallOptsWarning from '../snippets/installoptswarning.md';

<InstallOptsWarning />

The names of the variables correlate to the similar equivalent variables available here on the Transmission configuration docs page https://github.com/transmission/transmission/wiki/Editing-Configuration-Files

The following is an example of how this would look

```bash main
export download_dir='torrents/downloads'
```

For the directory options, the installer will create these automatically (e.g. `mkdir -p /home/${user}/${download_dir}`, etc.)

Please do note that in the event you have nginx installed, some of these settings will be overridden and the application will pass through the `/transmission` endpoint on your domain/IP.

## Troubleshooting

<Troubleshooting />

### My speeds to private trackers are slow
Please ensure that your peer ports are open. If you're not sure, change it to a different port and restart Transmission.

### It won't start
Please try running `transmission-daemon` in your terminal with the correct flags to keep it in the foreground, and watch what the output says.
