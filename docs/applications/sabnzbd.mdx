SABnzbd is a multi-platform binary newsgroup downloader. The program works in the background and simplifies the downloading verifying and extracting of files from Usenet. SABnzbd uses NZB files (similar to .torrent files, but for Usenet), instead of browsing Usenet directly.

## Initial Setup

Installing SABnzbd is easy. Simply issue the following command from SSH:

```bash main
sudo box install sabnzbd
```

This command will configure SABnzbd for your user.

## How to Access

After installation, you can access SABnzbd at the url: `https://<yourhostname.ltd>/sabnzbd`

## Service Management

SABnzbd is enabled for use with multiple users. Thus, you must call it with the username of the instance to start.

The systemd service file resides at:

```bash main
/etc/systemd/system/sabnzbd@.service
```

import SystemdTabs from '../snippets/systemdtabs.mdx';

<SystemdTabs service="sabnzbd@<username>"/>
