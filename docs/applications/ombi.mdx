Ombi is a self-hosted web application that automatically gives your shared Plex or Emby users the ability to request content by themselves! Ombi can be linked to multiple TV Show and Movie DVR tools to create a seamless end-to-end experience for your users. 

## Initial Setup

Installing Ombi is easy. Simply issue the following command from SSH:

```bash main
sudo box install ombi
```

This command will configure and install ombi for your user.

After installation, the files are stored in `/opt/Ombi` and the configuration and database are stored in `/etc/Ombi`

## Upgrading

Ombi v4 is installed and updated from the official stable repository. In order to keep ombi up-to-date, update your packages with:

```
sudo apt -y update
sudo apt -y upgrade
```

### Upgrading from v3 to v4
If you previously had ombi v3 installed, you can upgrade to v4 using the following command.
```bash
box upgrade ombi
```
When you've upgraded to v4, you can keep your application up to date with the steps mentioned in the [upgrading](#upgrading) chapter above.

## How to Access

After installation, Ombi will be available at the following web address: `https://<hostname.ltd>/ombi`

## Service Management

The systemd service for Ombi is not enabled for use in a multi-user environment, and it comes directly from the package itself.

In order for ombi to play well in our environment, we supply a `systemd` override file located in the path below.

```
/etc/systemd/system/ombi.service.d/override.conf
```

import SystemdTabs from '../snippets/systemdtabs.mdx';

<SystemdTabs service="ombi"/>
