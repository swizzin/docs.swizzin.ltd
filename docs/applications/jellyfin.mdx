Jellyfin is a self-hosted AV streaming platform. It is a FOSS fork of the Emby project.

## Installation
You can install Jellyfin using the following command.

```bash
sudo box install jellyfin
```
:::caution Finish install in browser
Please make sure to finish the setup of the application through the web browser, and create your admin user.
:::

## Access
You can access jellyfin through `https://domain.tld/jellyfin` if you have nginx installed, or through `https://domain.tld:port` if you do not.

## User management
Jellyfin manages its users in a separate database. **`box` does not add users to the database in any way**. You will need to manage the jellyfin users manually. Whether you choose to keep those in sync with box or not is up to you

## Adding more users' media to Jellyfin
import PermsSrv from '../snippets/permsmediasrv.mdx';

<PermsSrv serviceName="Jellyfin" serviceUsr="jellyfin"/>

## Service management
import SystemdTabs from '../snippets/systemdtabs.mdx';

<SystemdTabs service="jellyfin"/>

<Troubleshooting />

Jellyfin has a general [Troubleshooting guide](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/administration/troubleshooting.html) which we highly suggest you follow first in case you have any issues.

### Reinstallation Steps

If you have previously had a Jellyfin installation and are having issues with getting the server setup, use the following guide to get everything up and running:

1. Install Jellyfin on your server using the traditional steps above.
2. *in your browser* Navigate to your panel (yourdomain.tld)
3. Login
4. Right Click and hit "Inspect Element"
5. Go to "Storage"
6. Click "Local Storage" in the sidebar
7. Click the domain relating to your server
8. Find the key ``_deviceId2`` and delete it
9. Find the key ``jellyfin_credentials`` and delete it
10. Refresh / Reload the page.

### Unable to connect using apps
Some jellyfin clients will not work with self-signed certificates. For that reason we recommend that you follow the [LetsEncrypt](letsencrypt.mdx) guide and set up a valid signed certificate. You can grab a valid free domain from various places like `freenom`, or get a proper personalized one from places like `namecheap`.
