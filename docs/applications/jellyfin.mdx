## User management
Jellyfin manages its users in a separate database. **`box` does not add users to the database in any way**. You will need to manage the jellyfin users manually. Whether you choose to keep those in sync with box or not is up to you

<Troubleshooting />

Jellyfin has a general [Troubleshooting guide](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/administration/troubleshooting.html) which we highly suggest you follow first in case you have any issues.

### Unable to connect using apps
Some jellyfin clients will not work with self-signed certificates. For that reason we recommend that you follow the [LetsEncrypt](letsencrypt.mdx) guide and set up a valid signed certificate. You can grab a valid free domain from various places like `freenom`, or get a proper personalized one from places like `namecheap`.
