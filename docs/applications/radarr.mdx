Radarr is a movie collection manager for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new movies and will interface with clients and indexers to grab, sort, and rename them. 
It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of existing files in the library when a better quality format becomes available.

## Initial Setup

Installing Radarr is easy. Simply issue the following command:

```bash main
sudo box install radarr
```

This command will configure radarr for your user.

## How to Access

After Radarr has been installed, it will be available for access at `https://<hostname.ltd>/radarr`.

## Service Management

The Radarr service is managed by systemd and has been configured for single user usage. You can find the service file here:

```
/etc/systemd/system/radarr.service
```

import SystemdTabs from '../snippets/systemdtabs.mdx';

<SystemdTabs service="radarr"/>

## Configuration

In addition to the below Swizzin provided instructions, the Radarr Team built a detailed [Quick Start Guide] (https://wiki.servarr.com/Radarr_Quick_Start_Guide).

[Radarr's FAQ](https://wiki.servarr.com/Radarr_FAQ) may be of additional use as well.

Out of the box, Radarr comes with no configuration. Following are some basic tasks to help get your client up and running:

### Add a new movie (and your first root directory)

1. At the top, click Movies.
2. Click `Add New`
3. Type the name of the movie you want to add
4. Click the movie you want to add
5. Under `Root Folder`, choose `Add a new path`. Enter the path for the folder you wish to add your Radarr movies to and click the green check mark to add the directory.
  - e.g. `/home/<username>/media/Movies`
5. Change the other settings to your own needs
6. Click the green `Add Movie` button to add the movie.

### Connect download clients
import Conn4Arrs from '../snippets/conn4arr.mdx';

<Conn4Arrs />

### Add an indexer with Jackett
Radarr only supports a few trackers out of the box, but the indexers can be expanded by using the application [Jackett](jackett.mdx). To add an indexer with Jackett, use the following steps.

:::note
By default, when receiving the torznab feed from Jackett, it will need to be modified to be connected with the application. The default link looks like:

```plaintext
https://<yourhostname.ltd>/jackett/api/v2.0/indexers/yourtracker/results/torznab/
```

We need to edit this link to **remove https** and **add the port number**. Thus, if your port number was `12345`, your edited URL would look like this:

```plaintext
http://<yourhostname.ltd>:12345/jackett/api/v2.0/indexers/yourtracker/results/torznab/
```
:::

1. Go to `Settings > Indexers` and click `+` to add a new indexer.
2. Under `Torrent` choose `Torznab`
3. Use the settings:
```plaintext main
Name: <tracker name>
URL: <click copy torznab feed in jackett and modify as per above>
API: <copy and paste from jackett UI>
```
4. Click `Test`. If all is good, click `Save`.

### Other tasks

You may wish to further alter your setup by setting quality profiles or setting up post-processing so that media is automatically transferred to your Radarr library when your torrents or usenet downloads are completed. If you need further help, you can refer to the [Radarr Wiki](https://wiki.servarr.com/Radarr).

## Migrating to v3 on .Net Core 

Please follow the steps below to make sure you are using the Radarr v3 on the .Net binary
- Upgrade mono-based v0.2 to mono-based v3
    1. Trigger a backup manually by going to System -> Backup and press the "Backup" Button. Wait until the process has finished.
    1. Change the Release branch by going to Settings -> General -> Updates (ensure Advanced settings are shown), set the Branch value to `develop` and then press the Save button.
    1. Go to System -> Updates and install the latest update which should be version 3.x+
    1. Refresh your browser while emptying cache (CTRL+SHIFT+R on most browsers)
    1. Confirm you're running on version 3.x+ In System
    1. Change your branch back to `master`
- Migrate mono-based v3 to .Net-based v3
    1. Run `sudo box update`, which should Print out "`Moving Radarr from mono to .Net`" When the migration to .net has begun
    1. Refresh your browser while emptying cache (CTRL+SHIFT+R on most browsers)
    
If you are not running Radarr as your master user, you can set the environment variable `radarrOwner=<yourUser>`before the update, and the migration will respect the choice.
