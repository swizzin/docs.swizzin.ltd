Syncthing is a continuous file synchronization program. It synchronizes files between two or more computers in real time, safely protected from prying eyes. Your data is your data alone and you deserve to choose where it is stored, whether it is shared with some third party, and how it's transmitted over the internet.

## Initial Setup

Installing Syncthing is easy. Simply issue the following command from SSH:

```bash main
sudo box install syncthing
```
This command will configure and install syncthing for your user.

After installation, the config is stored in `~/.config/syncthing/`.

## How to Access

After installation, you can access the web client at `https://<hostname.ltd>/syncthing/`.

You can access the download section [here](https://syncthing.net/downloads/) for your other client that you plan to sync.
