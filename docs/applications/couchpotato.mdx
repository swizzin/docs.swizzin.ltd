## Initial Setup

Installing CouchPotato is easy. Simply issue the following command from SSH:

```bash main
sudo box install couchpotato
```

This command will configure and install CouchPotato for your user.

## How to Access

After CouchPotato has been configured for your user, the application can be accessed from your web browser at `https://<domain.ltd>/couchpotato`

During installation, the files were placed in your home folder: `~/.couchpotato`

## Service Management

The couchpotato service is managed by systemd. The systemd service file uses the multi-user format, but the service is not configured for any user other than the master.

The systemd service for couchpotato resides here:

```bash
/etc/systemd/system/couchpotato@.service
```

As the service utilizes the multi-user format, you must specify a username along with the command.

import SystemdTabs from '../snippets/systemdtabs.mdx';

<SystemdTabs service="couchpotato@<username>"/>
