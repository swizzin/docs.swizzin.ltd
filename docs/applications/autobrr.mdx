:::

## Initial Setup

Installing autobrr is easy. Simply issue the following command:

```bash main
sudo box install autobrr
```

This command will configure autobrr for your user.

## Upgrade

Upgrading autobrr is as easy. Simply issue the following command:

```bash main
sudo box upgrade autobrr
```

## How to Access

After autobrr has been installed, it will be available for access at `https://<hostname.ltd>/autobrr`.

The port is randomized at setup, so if you don't use `nginx`, or just need to find the port, check in `/home/user/.config/autobrr/config.toml`.

## Service Management

Multi-user is enabled, so in order to manipulate the service, you'll also need to specify a username.

```
/etc/systemd/system/autobrr@.service
```

import SystemdTabs from "../snippets/systemdtabs.mdx";

<SystemdTabs service="autobrr@<username>" />

## Configuration

In order to get autobrr working, you need to do the following steps:

- Setup indexers
  - Go to `Settings/Indexers` and add indexers
- Setup irc
  - Go to `Settings/Irc` and add networks and channels.
- Setup download clients
  - Go to `Settings/Clients` and add your download clients.
- Add filters
  - They work similar to autodl-irssi filters.

## Advanced Configuration

### Connecting to a Remote qBittorrent (Swizzin) Instance

Go to `Settings/Clients` and add your download client, then enter the following:

```plaintext
host: https://xxx.domain.ltd/qbittorrent
port: 0 (field will disappear)
tls: true
username: user
password: pass
Basic auth: true
user: basic user (same as user)
pass: basic pass (same as pass)
```
