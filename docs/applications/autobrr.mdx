autobrr is the modern download automation tool for torrents and usenet. With inspiration and ideas from tools like trackarr, autodl-irssi and flexget we built one tool that can do it all, and then some.

## Features
* Torrents and usenet support
* Support for 70+ torrent trackers with IRC announces
* Newznab, Torznab and RSS support to easily get access to hundreds of torrent and usenet indexers
* Torrent Magnet support
* Powerful but simple filtering with RegEx support (like in autodl-irssi)
* Easy to use and mobile friendly web UI (with dark mode!) to manage everything
* Built on Go and React making autobrr lightweight and perfect for supporting multiple platforms (Linux, FreeBSD, Windows, macOS) on different architectures (e.g. x86, ARM)
* Great container support (Docker, k8s/Kubernetes)
* Database engine supporting both PostgreSQL and SQLite
* Notifications (Discord, Telegram, Notifiarr, Pushover)
* One autobrr instance can communicate with multiple clients (torrent, usenet and *arr) on remote servers
* Base path / Subfolder (and subdomain) support for convenient reverse-proxy support

## Available download clients and actions
* qBittorrent (with built-in re-announce, categories, rules, max active downloads, etc.)
* Deluge v1+ and v2+
* rTorrent
* Transmission
* Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, Whisparr and Readarr (pushes releases directly to them and gets in the early swarm, instead of getting them via RSS when it's already over)
* SABnzbd (usenet)
* Watch folder
* Exec custom scripts
* Webhook

## Initial Setup

Installing autobrr is easy. Simply issue the following command:

```bash main
sudo box install autobrr
```

This command will configure autobrr for your user.

## Upgrade

Upgrading autobrr is as easy. Simply issue the following command:

```bash main
sudo box upgrade autobrr
```

## How to Access

After autobrr has been installed, it will be available for access at `https://<hostname.ltd>/autobrr`.

The port is randomized at setup, so if you don't use `nginx`, or just need to find the port, check in `/home/user/.config/autobrr/config.toml`.

## Service Management

Multi-user is enabled, so in order to manipulate the service, you'll also need to specify a username.

```
/etc/systemd/system/autobrr@.service
```

import SystemdTabs from "../snippets/systemdtabs.mdx";

<SystemdTabs service="autobrr@<username>" />

## Configuration

In order to get autobrr working, you need to do the following steps:

- Setup indexers
  - Go to `Settings/Indexers` and add indexers
- Setup irc
  - Go to `Settings/Irc` and add networks and channels.
- Setup download clients
  - Go to `Settings/Clients` and add your download clients.
- Add filters
  - They work similar to autodl-irssi filters.

## Advanced Configuration

### Connecting to a Remote qBittorrent (Swizzin) Instance

Go to `Settings/Clients` and add your download client, then enter the following:

```plaintext
host: https://xxx.domain.ltd/qbittorrent
port: 0 (field will disappear)
tls: true
username: user
password: pass
Basic auth: true
user: basic user (same as user)
pass: basic pass (same as pass)
```
