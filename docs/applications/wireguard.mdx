WireGuard is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography

## Initial Setup

Installing wireguard is easy. Simply issue the following command from SSH:

```bash main
sudo box install wireguard
```

At the end of the installation, the location of the config file for your user will be printed (`/home/<user>/.wireguard/<user>.conf`)

## How to Access

### Client Install
In order to use the Wireguard tunnel, you'll need to install the client on your local computer or mobile phone. In order to get started, please check the [Wireguard site](https://www.wireguard.com/install/) for help on installing Wireguard on the operating system of your choice.

:::note
If you prefer, an alternate client called [TunSafe](https://tunsafe.com/download) exists and is already a bit more mature than the official Wireguard client for Windows. **While the client itself is open-source and developed by a community member with prior credibility, it bears mentioning that using this client completely, 100% at your own risk as it is not developed or maintained by the Wireguard team. You have been warned.**

### Client Setup

Wireguard is available on many platforms. Setting it up for use with your swizzin configuration should be fairly straight-forward, but in case you need a little help getting your client setup, here are some instructions for popular operating systems.

<!--DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->
<!--Linux / OS X-->
::: panel
1. Simply copy-paste the content of the file outputted at the end of the server setup into a file in /etc/wireguard.
```bash
sudo nano /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
sudo chmod 600 /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
sudo wg-quick up wg0
```
2. Wireguard should now be up and tunnelling all you traffic through swizzin.
3. On Linux systems, you can configure a systemd service to automatically run and enable this configuration on each boot:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0
```
:::
<!--Windows-->
::: panel
1. Copy-paste the contents of the file outputted at the end of configuration into a file onto your local desktop,eg: `swizzin.conf.d`

2. Open TunSafe, click and drag the configuration file you just created to the TunSafe window. TunSafe will automatically import the client configuration and connect. Easy!

Configuration is easiest if you use utilize the QR Encode function.

1. Connect to your server from a computer and issue the commands:
```bash
u=$(whoami)
qrencode -t ansiutf8 < ~/.wireguard/$u.conf
```
2. In your client on your phone, add a new tunnel and chose the `QR Code` option. Scan the QR code which was generated in your terminal.
3. Enable the tunnel by ticking the switch.

After configuring your Wireguard Client, [check your IP Address](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ip+address&ia=answer).

## Service Management

Service management for wireguard is a bit different from other services. Wireguard interfaces are managed by the systemd service `wg-quick@.service`.

The default location for the wg-quick service is:

```bash
/lib/systemd/system/wg-quick@.service
```

Instead of usernames, wg-quick uses the id of the user as an identifier. You can easily find the id of your user with the command: `id -u <username>`

The basic construction of the service name is:

```bash
wg-quick@wg$(id -u <username>)
```

This service corresponds to the configuration file `wg$(id -u <username>).conf` in `/etc/wireguard`

Once you have the id of your user in question (for example, 1000), you can manipulate the service by calling it with:

```
wg-quick@wg1000
```

Calling `wg1000` essentially means use the conf file `/etc/wireguard/wg1000.conf` when calling `wg-quick`.


<!--DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->
<!--Start-->
```bash
sudo systemctl start wg-quick@wg1000
```
<!--Stop-->
```bash
sudo systemctl stop wg-quick@wg1000
```
<!--Restart-->
```bash
sudo systemctl restart wg-quick@wg1000
```
<!--Enable-->
```bash
sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg1000
```
<!--Disable-->
```bash
sudo systemctl disable wg-quick@wg1000
```
<!--Mask-->
:::panel
This disables the service and prevents a non-master user from managing it.

Make sure to first stop and disable the service with the other commands before masking the service
```bash
sudo systemctl mask wg-quick@wg1000
```
:::
<!--Unmask-->
:::panel
This removes the mask and enables a non-master user to manage the service.
```bash
sudo systemctl unmask wg-quick@wg1000
```

## Troubleshooting

import Troubleshooting from '../snippets/troubleshooting.md';

<Troubleshooting />

### WG doesn't work for any user except for the master
The multi-user functionality has been patched in at a later stage, probably after you have installed it. Please make sure to run `box update` and then remove and install wireguard again (`box remove wireguard && box install wireguard`). We have opted against patching this automatically as some administrators might not want to give their users WG access without knowing first.

### My connection is not being kept alive
This can happen when you are behind an NAT. Uncomment the following line at the end of your config. 

```plaintext
PersistentKeepalive = 25
```

### wg-quick: `wg100x' already exists
The service might have been shut down but the kernel process is probably still running. Verify using `htop` or some other process manager, and see if you can find any processes starting with `wg`, that match the id. You can then manually shut the service down using the following command.

```bash
wg-quick down wg100x
```
