WireGuard is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography

## Initial Setup

Installing wireguard is easy. Simply issue the following command from SSH:

```bash main
sudo box install wireguard
```

At the end of the installation, the location of the config file for your user will be printed (`/home/<user>/.wireguard/<user>.conf`)

### Managing service

import SystemdTabs from '../snippets/systemdtabs.mdx';

<SystemdTabs service="wg-quick@wg1000"/>

## How to Access

### Client Install
In order to use the Wireguard tunnel, you'll need to install the client on your local computer or mobile phone. In order to get started, please check the [Wireguard site](https://www.wireguard.com/install/) for help on installing Wireguard on the operating system of your choice.

:::note
If you prefer, an alternate client called [TunSafe](https://tunsafe.com/download) exists and is already a bit more mature than the official Wireguard client for Windows. **While the client itself is open-source and developed by a community member with prior credibility, it bears mentioning that using this client completely, 100% at your own risk as it is not developed or maintained by the Wireguard team. You have been warned.**

### Client Setup

Wireguard is available on many platforms. Setting it up for use with your swizzin configuration should be fairly straight-forward, but in case you need a little help getting your client setup, here are some instructions for popular operating systems.

### Generating QR Code for clients
You can quickly set up WG on your client by using the scannable qr-code. You can run the folllowing command to generate a quick QR inside of your terminal session, which you can scan with your device's camera.

```bash
qrencode -t ansiutf8 < ~/.wireguard/*.conf
```

## Troubleshooting

<Troubleshooting />

### WG doesn't work for any user except for the master
The multi-user functionality has been patched in at a later stage, probably after you have installed it. Please make sure to run `box update` and then remove and install wireguard again (`box remove wireguard && box install wireguard`). We have opted against patching this automatically as some administrators might not want to give their users WG access without knowing first.

### My connection is not being kept alive
This can happen when you are behind an NAT. Uncomment the following line at the end of your config. 

```plaintext
PersistentKeepalive = 25
```

### wg-quick: `wg100x' already exists
The service might have been shut down but the kernel process is probably still running. Verify using `htop` or some other process manager, and see if you can find any processes starting with `wg`, that match the id. You can then manually shut the service down using the following command.

```bash
wg-quick down wg100x
```
