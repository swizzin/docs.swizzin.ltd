Bazarr is a companion application to Sonarr and Radarr. It manages and downloads subtitles based on your requirements. You define your preferences by TV show or movie and Bazarr takes care of everything for you.

## Initial Setup

Installing Bazarr is easy. Simply issue the following command from SSH:

```plaintext main
sudo box install bazarr
```

This command will configure bazarr for the main user.

## How to Access

Once setup, bazarr will be available at the link `https://<hostname.ltd>/bazarr`


## Service Management

The systemd script for bazarr can be found at
```bash

```

By default, bazarr can only be configured for use with a single user with swizzin.

import SystemdTabs from '../snippets/systemdtabs.mdx';
