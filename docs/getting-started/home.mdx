swizzin was designed to be an easy to use, modular seedbox solution.

## System Requirements

### Supported Operating Systems

We only support Debian and Ubuntu LTS (Long term support) systems. Explicitly, that means the following:

- Debian 10, 11, 12
- Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04

### Recommended Hardware

- A KVM VPS or bare metal server is recommended
- 2+ CPU cores KVM or Intel Atom c2750
- 4 GB of RAM
- A processor compliant with one of the following architectures is required:
    - `x86_64`/`amd64` e.g. any modern computer/server
    - `aarch64`/`arm64` e.g. Apple Silicon, Raspberry Pi 2 v1.2 or newer (ARMv8)

With the exception of the processor architecture, these are not hard and fast requirements -- you may find that you're able to get away with running on a weaker CPU or less RAM; however, best performance will be had if the applications you're using have ample resource overhead.

## Installation

### Quick Start
:::caution Make sure you are root

Either login directly as root or elevate to root with proper login settings with either `su -` or `sudo -i`.

Don't use `su` or something like `sudo -s` (which is the default under Ubuntu when using `sudo`). You won't be fully logged in as root and certain environment variables not having the full perspective of root will cause failures.
:::


Have either `curl` or `wget` installed, on a fresh minimal installation, these packages might be missing. Pick the command of your choice to get started:

import InstallCmd from '../snippets/installcmd.js';

<InstallCmd />

### Setup

After running the above command, the script will check for updates and install some necessary prerequisites before continuing.

When finished, the installer will ask you a few questions:

- A username for the master user
- A password for the master user
- The packages you would like to install

:::caution Valid username

When you create the Swizzin master user or any additional user, do not use the username that you used to connect to the server threw SSH.
When you add a user through Swizzin, it creates a Linux user, so using the same username twice may prevent you from connecting through SSH again.
:::

In text fields, you only need to enter your text and hit `return` to enter. To choose packages, from the list, you can navigate with the arrow keys. Press `space` to select an entry. When you're satisfied with your selection, press `tab` to move the selector to `Ok` and then press enter. This will advance the screen.

When you have finished running through the prompts, installation will start. The time it takes will depend on the number of packages you have selected.

### Advanced setup
There's a whole bunch of options for the setup.sh to achieve custom/unattended setups, which you can read all about [in this guide](/guides/advanced-setup).

#### Additional Setup Quirks

A few items to be aware of as known issues. Most of these have had attempts at working around them, but it's good to be aware of things to avoid:

- Installer appears frozen before any user input (usually on `Installing dependencies` or `Checking repos`): `control-c` out and `apt update && apt upgrade` before running the installer.
- Capital letters in usernames: capital letters should never be used for usernames
- Usernames wh
