:::warning
None of the scripts and projects below are supported by swizzin. If you use these, you will not get support. Make sure you know what you're doing!
:::

Below is a list of cusomtisations, scripts and repos that you can use to get something a little more custom on your box.

:::info
Make sure to not update your swizzin from the git repo afterwards, as that could break your install. Please see the [section on updating](/dev/setup#updating-mechanism) in the dev documentation.

:::success Check out our beta features too!
Our release cycle is a little slow due to a low amount of testers, so if you want to help out and provide feedback for us and get to use new apps and features before everyone else, please check out the [Beta testing docs](dev/beta-testing)
