None of these are required for you to define if you want an easy install. If you would like to do something custom, then here are some options for you.

:::caution Make sure you know what you're doing!
**Please note that it is difficult for us to support these options as they are custom for each install**

None of the options are sanity-checked on install so setting something wrong could break your installation.

Again, you do not need to set these if you don't know what you're doing.
:::

There are a couple options you can set **before** installing transmission through export. 

If you'd like to use one of these, run `export option=value` **before** running the install command.
